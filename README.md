#  Spotify Songs Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Spotify songs. The goal is to uncover musical trends, analyze popular features, and derive insights into what makes a song successful on the platform.

##  Objective

The key objectives of this analysis include:

- Understanding the distribution of audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, and loudness
- Analyzing top songs and their characteristics
- Exploring relationships between song popularity and musical attributes
- Identifying trends across genres, release years, and artists

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains attributes for thousands of songs available on Spotify, including:

- **Name** – Track title
- **Artists** – Artist(s) name
- **Release date**
- **Popularity**
- **Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Tempo, Valence**
- **Duration (ms), Acousticness, Speechiness, Instrumentalness**
- **Genre (if included)**

> The dataset may have been sourced via Spotify API or a third-party CSV export.
